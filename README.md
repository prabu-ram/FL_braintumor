Federated learning framework in Brain tumor segmentation for more privacy. The model was trained on the lgg-MRI
segmentation dataset and used a ResNet model. A Federated learning pipeline was introduced so that the patientâ€™s privacy
is maintained. It gave similar accuracy to that of Centralized Learning.
